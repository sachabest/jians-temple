Comments from Shlane:
1. Need a reason for the guardian to stay moving / active
	Possible solutions
		Need to recharge. Resets some countdown that causes a penalty. Find food? Visit altars?
		Limited ammunition for the conversion feature
		Something that keeps the guardian from standing on top of the treasure
2. Need some interactivity for guardian running back to room
	Hold/mash a button to make him go faster (should also display a prompt) 
3. Need some way for the guardian to know where the explorers are, explorers know where guardian is
	Guardian makes directional noise, stomps, whatever
	Possible solutions for guardian finding players:
		Light indication, seeing the torches from a distance
		Limited xray vision? (Probably too strong)
		Sonar / radar pulse
			Guardian makes a noise everyone is able to hear, then gets visual indicators for the directions of all remaining explorers
			Think Dragon Age Inquisition’s item/object search function
			Would need a cooldown of some sort
4. Need some sort of feedback to show that you are going in the right direction
	Possible solutions (whatever we use should somehow be described to the players):
		Some procedural geographic feature, IE the treasure is at the deepest point in the temple, so if you’re heading down stairs you know you’re getting closer
		Torches that are colored differently on the correct path
		Rooms with statues on pedestals that face the direction of the treasure
			Can be literally anything with an identifiable front / pointing direction. Face, gesturing figure, animal
		Minimap with trail?
